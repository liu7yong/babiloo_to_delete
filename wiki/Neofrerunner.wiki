=Intro=

The objective of this module is creating a graphics user interface that emphasizes simplicity and lightness. As development focuses on keeping weight down to a minimum, only the most essential features are implemented. It should be simple to use, requires few libraries and starts up quickly.
The main target is the openmoko Freerunner cellphone (http://www.openmoko.org) and secondly the netbook.
If you need a full-features program, you have to use the QT interface.
